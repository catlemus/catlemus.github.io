          <!-- add more about me -->
          I am a second year student at Virginia Tech Majoring in Computer
          Science and minoring in Human Computer Interaction.

          I enjoy the creative side
          of Computer Science and can spend hours at a time on the design of my next
          creation. I find Computer Science exciting and have the goal of becoming a
          Software Engineer. The idea of being in a constantly changing field is exciting
          and I take every opportunity I can to learn more. I am constantly starting new
          personal projects such as building this website, learning how to build virtual
          reality environments with Unity, or learning how to build a mobile app with Flutter.
           I have
          participated in Hackathons such as Technica which I a plan to do again next year
          and other hackathons hosted at Virginia Tech.
          I am a curious and creative person always looking for my next challenge.
          In my free time I enjoy hiking with my dogs (I have a german shepherd and a
          chocolate lab), watching new movies, and trying new foods.

              so through this process I have been learning Dart as well.

              While participating the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion
              Program I developed a mobile app in collaboration with
              three other girls. This mobile app can to find a women's correct
              pants size across various different stores based on the measurements
              guides provided by each specific store.

              I developed pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during

              I developed a website for my favorite dog and a website to
              play a game similar to Flappy Bird but pocket themed.
